Capturing Physiological Response to Art Stimulus Set

 Data collection and video recording for MATLAB Art Physio  'art_physio.m' & init_physio.m'
 
 Experiment for collecting data on image preference and emotional reaction to artwork. 
 
 MATLAB is used to present a set of artwork images to subjects
 Processing captures image sequences of the facial expressions of subjects, and to write physiological 
 and Matlab correlation data to a csv file
 Arduino is used to collect heart rate data from a Pulse Oximeter sensor
 CERT (Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox) is used to process image sequence of subject facial expression
 
 CERT data is then analyzed using MATLAB
